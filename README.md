# Welcome to Discomoka 3!
Discomoka 3 is (yet another) Discord Bot which serves you Music and other fun stuff.

Discomoka is the spiritual successor to Momoka, a TeamSpeak music bot I developed a few years ago with the same core feature: playing & managing music.
The name "Discomoka" is a combination of Discord and Momoka.
